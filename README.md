Chestpack - extra storage in a backpack on your chest!

Chestpack enables players to craft a wearable chest for extra storage while traveling.
It is designed to enable carrying additional items realistically without being
too overpowered.

Features:

* Crafting recipe for packs
* Configurable storage size
* Wear pack as chestplate for storage
* Hold pack in your hand to open it
* Packs are unique and not per-player
* Somewhat realistic

## Usage
Craft a pack by surrounding a chest with leather.

When holding the resulting chest (it appears the same as a normal chest, but is
actually a special wearable chest), left-click to open the pack. You can drag items
to/from the pack and your inventory, as you would expect.

When it isn't held in your hand, the pack will move itself to your
chestplate armor slot, representing the pack being worn on your back as a backpack
(or on your chest as a chestpack, whatever interpretation you prefer). This is where
the pack normally resides.

To get back into your pack, take it off your back and move it into your hand. Left-click
to open it. 

## Configuration
packSize (45): The number of slots for each pack. Must be a multiple of 9. For reference
27 is a small chest, 54 is a large chest. The default of 45 is slightly smaller than a 
double chest.

## Permissions and Commands
None

## Caveats
The chest pack item shows up as a normal "Chest" in the player inventory. But its behavior
should make it clear how it differs (it auto-equips, can be opened, doesn't stack with other chests).

Packs can be nested indefinitely for more storage.
